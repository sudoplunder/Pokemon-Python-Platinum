The Pok\u00e9mon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a substitute will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as spikes.\n\nThis ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.\n\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves.",
