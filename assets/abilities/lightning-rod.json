Other Pok\u00e9mon's Electric moves raise this Pok\u00e9mon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.\n\nIf the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pok\u00e9mon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pok\u00e9mon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.\n\nIf the Pok\u00e9mon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost.",
