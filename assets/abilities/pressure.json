This ability does not affect ally moves that target either the entire field or just its side, nor this Pok\u00e9mon's self-targetted moves; it does, however, affect single-targetted ally moves aimed at this Pok\u00e9mon, ally moves that target all other Pok\u00e9mon, and opponents' moves that target the entire field.  If this ability raises a move's PP cost above its remaining PP, it will use all remaining PP.\n\nWhen this Pok\u00e9mon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pok\u00e9mon has this ability, higher-levelled Pok\u00e9mon have their encounter rate increased.",
