Pok\u00e9mon otherwise immune to ground moves are affected during gravity.\n\nIf a poison Pok\u00e9mon not immune to ground moves enters a field covered with poisoned spikes, the spikes are removed.\n\nrapid spin will remove this effect from its user's side of the field.  defog will remove this effect from its target's side of the field.\n\nThis move does not trigger synchronize, unless the Pok\u00e9mon with synchronize was forced to enter the field by another effect such as roar.\n\nPok\u00e9mon entering the field due to baton pass are not affected by this effect.",
