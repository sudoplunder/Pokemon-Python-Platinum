"""Level cap & obedience (disobedience) helpers.

Implements simple badge-based level cap and a probability that a PokÃ©mon
above the cap will disobey and waste its turn.

Mapping (inclusive caps):
  0 badges -> 20 (assumed; spec started at 1 badge so we pick a conservative pre-badge cap)
  1 badge  -> 25
  2 badges -> 30
  3 badges -> 35
  4 badges -> 40
  5 badges -> 45
  6 badges -> 50
  7 badges -> 55
  8 badges -> 100 

Disobedience chance scales 10% per level above the cap, clamped at 50%.
This is a simplification of the mainline formula.
