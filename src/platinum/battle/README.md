# Battle System - Pokemon Python Platinum

This directory will contain the battle system implementation.

## Planned Components

- `models.py` - Pokemon, moves, and battle state models
- `mechanics.py` - Damage calculation, status effects, battle logic
- `ai.py` - AI opponent behavior
- `wild.py` - Wild Pokemon encounter system
- `trainer.py` - Trainer battle logic

## Next Steps

The battle system will be implemented in future PRs, starting with:
1. Basic Pokemon and move models
2. Wild battle mechanics (MVP)
3. Trainer battles
4. Advanced features (abilities, items, etc.)

For now, battles use a placeholder that logs the battle request and continues.
